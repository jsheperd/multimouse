# multimouse
Monitor the positions of all the mouses on linux

It is originally a simple test about monitor multiple streams in the same time.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/jsheperd/multimouse  
cd multimouse  
go build -o multimouse main.go && sudo ./multimouse  
```

Just move your pointers
